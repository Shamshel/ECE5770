% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.

\section{Introduction}
The Remote Rover Training System (hereon referred to as ``the System'') is a mechanically simple mobile robot intended to provide a training platform for aspiring engineers and scientists who may use such robotics in the course of their duties.  The System is intended to provide a gentile and easy introduction to developing real-time operating systems on a remote mobile robot which is easily replaceable and robust enough to avoid being damaged by faulty programming.

\section{Physical Requirements}
These requirements outline restrictions on the System regarding size, weight, accessibility, and mobility.
\subsection{The System shall weigh no more than can be carried by a single person.}
\subsection{The System shall be capable of fitting in a person's arms comfortably.}
\subsection{The system shall expose all components and circuitry to the user with the removal of at most one access panel.}
\subsection{The system shall be capable of easily traversing a room with a carpet of no more than 1/2 inch thickness.}

\section{Electrical Requirements}
These requirements outline restrictions on the System regarding operational duration, range, and sensor capabilities.

\subsection{Power and Operational Requirements}
\subsubsection{The System shall be battery powered.}
\subsubsection{The System shall utilize a battery with is rechargeable.}
\subsubsection{The System shall have enough stored energy to operate without activating its motors for at least an hour without recharging.}
\subsubsection{The System shall have enough stored energy to traverse a room without recharging.}

\subsection{Transmission and Communication Requirements}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of receiving commands remotely.}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of sending sensor data remotely.}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of receiving software updates remotely.}

\subsection{Sensor Requirements}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of determining the distance travelled from its origin.}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of determining the remaining battery power available.}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of determining the power dissipated through the drive motors.}

\section{Mechanical Requirements}
These requirements outline restrictions on mechanical operations the System shall be capable of performing.

\subsection{Motivation Requirements}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of travelling forward and reverse.}
\subsubsection{The System shall be capable of rotating clockwise and counterclockwise without travelling forward or reverse.}
